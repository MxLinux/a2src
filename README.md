# a2src

Simple script for decompiling Android .APK files. 
Currently depends on aliases I have set in my ~/.bash_profile, so I don't have to provide dex2jar or apktool.

TODO:
- Replace alias requirements with environmental variables
- Search user home directory for dex2jar/apktool if their location isn't found in environmental variables
- Support for jadx
